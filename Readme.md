## **Glasp Limitations**
Just like every other web extension that has shortcomings, Glasp is not left out. These are some issues that the current Glasp extension possesses. 

- Privacy issues: Since GLASP retains users' highlighted content on its servers, some users may have privacy issues. 

- Dependence on user input: The involvement and contributions of GLASP's users are essential to the tool's success as a collaborative one. It might not be as helpful as it could be if there aren't many users actively sharing stuff on the platform.

- Limited compatibility: GLASP is currently only available as a browser extension for Google Chrome and Safari. This means that users of other browsers may not be able to use the tool, which could limit its accessibility.

The tool offers some unique and interesting features such as efficient reading, social networking, collaborative reading and personal knowledge management. If you're interested in utilizing GLASP, you can quickly and easily install the browser extension for Safari or Google Chrome and get started. However, before deciding whether GLASP or any other tool of a similar nature is the right fit for you, it is crucial to remember that every tool has its own strengths and weaknesses.
